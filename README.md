A classic Blackjack game implemented in Java programming language. The game features a simple user interface and basic game mechanics, allowing players to experience the thrill of the popular casino game from the comfort of their own device.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites
You need to have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of JDK from the official Java SE Downloads page. This game was programmed in the NetBeans IDE. Please be sure to have the IDE installed before use.

## Installing

After downloading the repository, open a new project in NetBeans, navigate to the main window, right click, and hit "run".

## Gameplay
The objective of the game is to beat the dealer by having a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible, without exceeding it. The game starts with the player being dealt two cards, and the dealer being dealt one card face up and one card face down. The player can choose to hit (take another card) or stand (keep their current hand). If the player exceeds a hand value of 21, they lose the game.
